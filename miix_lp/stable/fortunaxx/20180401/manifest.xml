**Hi early flasher!**

We'll be moving you to the Supra branch, where all the fun happens. Users under the Supra branch gets update more frequently than users under the Stable branch. This ensures that we are able to fix bugs and issues before the update rolls out to a lot of people. Note that reverting to stable is possible, but is not available at the moment. Being a user under the Supra branch after release however, will be available starting 14th April.

Again, please never forget to report bugs, so we can fix it before release!
